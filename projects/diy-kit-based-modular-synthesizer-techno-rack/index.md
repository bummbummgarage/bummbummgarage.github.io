# A Modular Synth Techno Rack based on DIY Kits

**Clearly making techno!** That's how I got into the world of modular synthesizers. With [my DIY drum machine](/projects/diy-modular-synthesizer-drum-machine/) I have laid the foundations. Now I want to make music!

## Sound

This is the kind of music that I am envisioning:

* [Lady Starlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXC-RGnLXOU)
* [Tunegirl](https://www.instagram.com/the_tunegirl/)
* [Karenn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVsfzprO7zs)
* [Amelie Lens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJkuTx1DQzg)
* [Layton Giordani](https://youtu.be/jYXeI_TGx9s?t=110)

## Setup

I'm creating **a mobile rack to play live**. And because I can (and because it's fun), I'm building it **based on DIY kits**.

According to the video "[How to make a TINY live techno modular synth in only 62HP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jCCzpWBsFs)" by Mylar Melodies, you need: **drums, bass, lead (e.g. chords) and freaky noises**.

Following that approach, I'm adding what is missing and replacing what needs to be improved. **Step by step**.

## Result

By the beginning of February 2022, I called the project finished 🎉 and happily started recording next level tracks.
