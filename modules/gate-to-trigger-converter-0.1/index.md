Gate to Trigger Converter that I built for my drum machine project. I realized that the outcome of my gate generator (clock) that is fed into the ADSR prototype didn't result in sufficiently snappy drum hits. So I pulled together this simple module to have short triggers. It is based on the ["Gate to Trigger Converter" by Ken Stone](https://www.elby-designs.com/webtek/cgs/cgs24/cgs24_gatetotrigger.html).
