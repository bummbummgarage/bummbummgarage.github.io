# VCA

*Version 0.2 from February 2021*

VCA that I built for my modular synth drum machine project. It's the second and simpliest VCA in my system. Deadly pure based on a single opto coupler (vactrol). The core is passive. I added a LED for the indication of the control voltage, so it needs power.

The design is based on ["Vactrol VCA" by Kristian Blåsol](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o6oiyanco8lzmvt/Schematic_Vactrol.pdf).

## Improvement Potential

There some distortion in the output. Furthermore the design doesn't work with negative voltages. Fortunately sufficient enough for the sounds of my drum machine project 👍🏻
