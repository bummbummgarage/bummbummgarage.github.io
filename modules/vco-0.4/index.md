## VCO

*Version 0.4 from September 2020*

![](120069748_171071121269591_6942984310127158100_n.jpg)

VCO that I pulled together for my drum machine project. It's based on a former standalone version and now migrated to Eurorack format since I decided to go into this direction.

### Features

✅ Square, triangle and sine wave

✅ Variable frequency range (30 Hz to 13 kHz)

✅ CV input with variable attenuation

✅ Variable DC

### Details

I found a thankful way to assemble the stripboard and the front panel by using the interface components, like the potis and audio jacks (Doepfer style).
