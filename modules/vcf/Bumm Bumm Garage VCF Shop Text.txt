Bumm Bumm Garage – Voltage Controlled Filter (VCF)

The Bumm Bumm Garage VCF is a voltage controlled low and high pass filter. It features everything that you need for creating unique timbres in your voices or giving them a designated place in the mix. Just plug your audio in the HPF or LPF jack, connect the output to the next stage in your chain and start shaping your sound!

The circuit of the filter is based on a Korg MS20 adaptation by René Schmitz. It has a spacious board layout and a reduced variety of component values to ensure the smoothest assembly possible.
