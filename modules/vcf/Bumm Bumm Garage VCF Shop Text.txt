SOUND:

The Bumm Bumm Garage VCF is a voltage controlled low and high pass filter. It features everything that you need for creating unique timbres in your voices or giving them a designated place in the mix. Just plug your audio in the HPF (high pass filter) or LPF (low pass filter) jack, connect the output to the next stage in your chain and start shaping your sound!

Shaping blabla is a breeze … by using the CV and … the resonance switch for non-linear (chaotic) responses.




BUILD:

It is based on the "late Korg MS20 filter" by René Schmitz 
- Few different components – I try to limit the values and types to few and simple. For example, I am very happy if the values of the resistors in a kit are limited to 1K, 10K, and 100K.
- The usage is smooth, the build was easy
- Hi :) finished the filter, worked on first plug :) well done, it was fun to solder it and it was well designed.

Voltage controlled filter that I built for my techno rack. It’s based on “Korg late MS20 filter” by René Schmitz.

René explains in the description how to add the high pass input. I didn’t manage to make it a switch, so there are two separate inputs for high pass and low pass 🤷‍♂️

Then I accidentally found out that if I remove one of the diodes in the original design, the resonance gets a crunchy color (which I find particularly nice for bass voices). So I implemented this function with a switch: Soft and hard resonance.

SOUND:
- hard resonance klingt richtig nice. Ich mag das nicht-lineare.
- Oh it works great, I love the sound
- I like that it’s not perfect and has some character, and adding the resonance switch was a good idea
- Actually it sounds amazing and the switch to hard/soft results in some great grit. All in all great filter, I’ll not be letting it go anytime soon.
- Sounds cool, only tested it for a small session, the resonance is really nice.
